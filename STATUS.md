# STATUS
We are applying for the following badges:
- Artifacts Available: All of our artifacts including the survey in German and English, and the raw data of participant responses are available in a [Zenodo package](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12529996)
- Artifact Evaluated - Functional: All artifacts are documented in the README.md in this repository. Using the markdown of our survey, the questionnaire is exercisable without any tooling requirements. In addition, we also provide the [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) export from our original survey to redistribute our survey to new target audiences using limesurvey. Furthermore, with the raw data from our responses, the described extraction results of our paper can be reproduced accordingly.
