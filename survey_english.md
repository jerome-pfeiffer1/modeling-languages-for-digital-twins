## Questions about the understanding of digital twins

Here we would like to ask you about your understanding of the characteristics, goals and benefits of digital twins.

**Cyber-physical systems (CPS)** combine computational processes with physical processes. Embedded computers, which are networked via radio or cabling, monitor and control the physical processes via sensors, usually with feedback loops in which physical processes affect computations and vice versa.


### Properties of digital twins
What characteristics do you think digital twins have? Indicate your agreement with the following statements.

Please select the correct answer for each item (single choice per row):
